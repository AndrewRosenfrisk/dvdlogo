# Bouncing DVD Logo

## About

If you are of a certain age, you’ll remember those ancient technological devices 
called DVD players. When not playing DVDs, they would display a diagonally traveling 
DVD logo that bounced off the edges of the screen. This program simulates this colorful 
DVD logo by making it change direction each time it hits an edge. We’ll also keep track 
of how many times a logo hits a corner of the screen. This creates an interesting visual 
animation to look at, especially for the magical moment when a logo lines up perfectly with a corner.
